PeleLM - README
===============

`PeleLM` is an adaptive-mesh low Mach number hydrodynamics code for reacting flows.  `PeleLM` has a project
`homepage <https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PeleLM/>`_, and can be obtained via
`GitHub <https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PeleLM>`_.  
Use `this link <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pelelmusers/join>`_ to 
to sign up for the PeleLM user forum, where
updates and significant changes will be posted.  The forum is also where general questions can be posted about
building and running the code, processing code output, and details about the algorithm and its implementation.

Getting started with PeleLM
---------------------------

* To compile and run the `Pele` suite of codes, one needs a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard and a Fortran compiler that supports the 2003 standard.  A hierarchical strategy for parallelism is supported, based MPI + OpenMP.  The codes work with all major MPI and OpenMP implementations.  The codes should build and run with no modifications to the `make` system if using a Linux system with the GNU compilers, version 4.8.4 and above.


To build `PeleLM` and run a sample 2D flame problem:

1. Set the environment variable, AMREX_HOME, and clone a copy of `AMReX` there ::

    export AMREX_HOME=<location for AMReX>
    git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.git ${AMREX_HOME}
       or (if you have the proper SSH keys set in your GitHub settings)
    git clone git@github.com:AMReX-Codes/amrex.git ${AMREX_HOME}

2. Set the environment variable, IAMR_HOME, and clone a copy of `IAMR` there ::

    export IAMR_HOME=<location for IAMR>
    git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/IAMR.git ${IAMR_HOME}
       or (if you have the proper SSH keys set in your GitHub settings)    
    git clone git@github.com:AMReX-Codes/IAMR.git ${IAMR_HOME}

3. Set the environment variable, PELELM_HOME, and clone a copy of `PeleLM` there ::

    export PELELM_HOME=<location for PeleLM>
    git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PeleLM.git ${PELELM_HOME}
       or (if you have the proper SSH keys set in your GitHub settings)
    git clone git@github.com:AMReX-Combustion/PeleLM.git ${PELELM_HOME}

4. Set the environment variable, PELE_PHYSICS_HOME, and clone a copy of `PelePhysics` there ::

    export PELE_PHYSICS_HOME=<location for PelePhysics>
    git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics.git ${PELE_PHYSICS_HOME}
       or (if you have the proper SSH keys set in your GitHub settings)
    git clone git@github.com:AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics.git ${PELE_PHYSICS_HOME}

5. Move to an example build folder, build an executable ::

    cd ${PELELM_HOME}/Exec/RegTests/FlameSheet
    make
    ./PeleLM2d.xxx.yyy.ex inputs.2d-regt

* Notes

   A. In the exec line above, xxx.yyy is a tag identifying your compiler and various build options, and will vary across pltaform.  (Note that GNU compilers must be at least 4.8.4, and MPI should be at least version 3).
   B. The example is 2D premixed flame, flowing vertically upward through the domain with no gravity. The lateral boundaries are periodic.  A detailed methane model is used.  The solution is initialized with a wrinkled (perturbed) 1D steady flame solution computed using the PREMIX code.  Two levels of solution-adaptive refinement are automatically triggered by the presence of the flame intermediate, H.
   C. In addition to informative output to the terminal, periodic plotfiles are written in the run folder.  These may be viewed with CCSE's Amrvis (<https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/Amrvis>) for example. Please look at the AMReX documentation for further options about visualization (<https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Visualization.html>).


Dependencies
------------

`PeleLM` was created in 2017 by renaming `LMC`, the low Mach code from
`CCSE <https://ccse.lbl.gov>`_, and is built on the `AMReX` library
and the `IAMR` code (see above).

Development model
-----------------

To add a new feature to PeleLM, the procedure is:

1. Create a branch for the new feature (locally) ::

    git checkout -b AmazingNewFeature

2. Develop the feature, merging changes often from the development branch into your AmazingNewFeature branch ::
   
    git commit -m "Developed AmazingNewFeature"
    git checkout development
    git pull                     [fix any identified conflicts between local and remote branches of "development"]
    git checkout AmazingNewFeature
    git merge development        [fix any identified conflicts between "development" and "AmazingNewFeature"]

3. Push feature branch to PeleLM repository ::

    git push -u origin AmazingNewFeature [Note: -u option required only for the first push of new branch]

4.  Submit a merge request through the github project page - be sure you are requesting to merge your branch to the development branch.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation for PeleLM is under development in the Docs directory.  To build ::

    cd ${PELELM_HOME}/Docs
    make html
