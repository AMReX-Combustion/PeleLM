This documentation is a work in progress.  \lmc\ is rapidly
evolving, so portions of the text are likely to be incomplete or
out-of-date. \\

\noindent \lmc\ is developed primarily at the Center for Computational Sciences and
Engineering at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Development has been supported
by the SciDAC Program of the DOE Office of Mathematics, Information, and Computational Sciences
under the U.S. Department of Energy under contract No.\ DE-AC02-05CH11231. \\

\noindent \lmc\ uses the \boxlib\ library,
developed at the Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  \boxlib\ is distributed
separately from \lmc\ (see
