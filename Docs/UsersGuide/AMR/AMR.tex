Our approach to adaptive refinement in \lmc\ uses a nested
hierarchy of logically-rectangular grids with simultaneous refinement
of the grids in both space and time.  The integration algorithm on the grid hierarchy
is a recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced in time,
fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach the same time
as the coarse grids and the data at different levels are then synchronized.

During the regridding step, increasingly finer grids
are recursively embedded in coarse grids until the solution is
sufficiently resolved.  An error estimation procedure based on
user-specified criteria (described in Section \ref{sec:tagging}) 
evaluates where additional refinement is needed
and grid generation procedures dynamically create or
remove rectangular fine grid patches as resolution requirements change.

A good introduction to the style of AMR used here is in Lecture 1

\section{Tagging for Refinement}
\label{sec:tagging}

\lmc\ determines what zones should be tagged for refinement at the next 
regridding step by using a set of built-in routines that test on 
quantities such as the density and pressure and determining whether the 
quantities themselves or their gradients pass a user-specified threshold. 
This may then be extended if {\tt amr.n\_error\_buf} $> 0$ to a certain number 
of zones beyond these tagged zones. This section describes the process 
by which zones are tagged, and describes how to add customized tagging criteria.

The routines for tagging cells are located in the {\tt Prob\_nd.f90} file 
in the {\tt Src\_nd} directory. The main routines are 
{\tt denerror}, {\tt temperror}, {\tt presserror}, {\tt velerror}. They refine
based on density, temperature, pressure, and velocity, respectively. The same approach is used 
for all of them. As an example, we consider the density tagging routine. There 
are four parameters that control tagging. If the density in a zone is greater than 
the user-specified parameter {\tt denerr}, then that zone will be tagged 
for refinement, but only if the current AMR level is less than the 
user-specified parameter {\tt max\_denerr\_lev}. Similarly, 
if the absolute density gradient between a zone and any adjacent zone 
is greater than the user-specified parameter {\tt dengrad}, that zone 
will be tagged for refinement, but only if we are currently on a level 
below {\tt max\_dengrad\_lev}. Note that setting {\tt denerr} alone will 
not do anything; you'll need to set {\tt max\_dengrad\_lev} $>= 1$ for
this to have any effect.

All four of these parameters are set in the {\tt \&tagging} namelist 
in your {\tt probin} file. If left unmodified, they default to a value 
that means we will never tag. The complete set of parameters that can 
be controlled this way is the following:
\begin{multicols}{5}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemindent}{-3em}
  \item {\tt denerr}
  \item {\tt max\_denerr\_lev}
  \item {\tt dengrad}
  \item {\tt max\_dengrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt temperr}
  \item {\tt max\_temperr\_lev}
  \item {\tt tempgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_tempgrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt velerr}
  \item {\tt max\_velerr\_lev}
  \item {\tt velgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_velgrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt presserr}
  \item {\tt max\_presserr\_lev}
  \item {\tt pressgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_pressgrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt raderr}
  \item {\tt max\_raderr\_lev}
  \item {\tt radgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_radgrad\_lev}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
Since there are multiple algorithms for determining 
whether a zone is tagged or not, it is worthwhile to specify 
in detail what is happening to a zone in the code during this step. 
We show this in the following pseudocode section. A zone 
is tagged if the variable {\tt itag = SET}, and is not tagged 
if {\tt itag = CLEAR} (these are mapped to 1 and 0, respectively).

\begin{verbatim}
itag = CLEAR

for errfunc[k] from k = 1 ... N
    // Three possibilities for itag: SET or CLEAR or remaining unchanged
    call errfunc[k](itag)  
end for
\end{verbatim}

In particular, notice that there is an order dependence of this operation; if {\tt errfunc[2]} 
{\tt CLEAR}s a zone and then {\tt errfunc[3]} {\tt SET}s that zone, the final operation will 
be to tag that zone (and vice versa). In practice by default this does not matter, because the 
built-in tagging routines never explicitly perform a \texttt{CLEAR}. However, 
it is possible to overwrite the {\tt Tagging\_nd.f90} file if you want to change how 
{\tt ca\_denerror, ca\_temperror}, etc. operate. This is not recommended, and if you do so
be aware that {\tt CLEAR}ing a zone this way may not have the desired effect.

We provide also the ability for the user to define their own tagging criteria.
This is done through the Fortran function {\tt set\_problem\_tags} in the 
{\tt problem\_tagging\_*d.f90} files. This function is provided the entire 
state (including density, temperature, velocity, etc.) and the array 
of tagging status for every zone. As an example of how to use this, suppose we 
have a 3D Cartesian simulation where we want to tag any zone that has a 
density gradient greater than 10, but we don't care about any regions 
outside a radius $r > 75$ from the problem origin; we leave them always unrefined. 
We also want to ensure that the region $r \leq 10$ is always refined.
In our {\tt probin} file we would set {\tt denerr = 10} and {\tt max\_denerr\_lev = 1}
in the {\tt \&tagging} namelist. We would also make a copy of 
{\tt problem\_tagging\_3d.f90} to our work directory and set it up as follows:
