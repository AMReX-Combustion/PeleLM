Convected Gaussian - README
================================

Description
-----------

The convection of a scalar gaussian perturbation is a classical test case for computational fluid dynamics solvers. It allows to directly evaluate the numerical characteristics of the solver by comparison with analytical solution. It consists in convecting a gaussian perturbation of a scalar (temperature or species mass fraction) across a periodic 2D box.
