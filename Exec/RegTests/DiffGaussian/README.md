Diffusing Gaussian - README
================================

Description
-----------

The diffusion of a scalar gaussian perturbation is a classical test case for computational fluid dynamics solvers. It allows to directly evaluate the numerical characteristics of the solver by comparison with analytical solution. It consists in the diffusion of an initial gaussian perturbation of a scalar (temperature or species mass fraction) across a periodic 2D box.
