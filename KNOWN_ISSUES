Here's a running list of known issues or less-than-perfect features of PeleLM that we should address someday.
Periodically, we should revisit this list and see if things have already been fixed, or can easily be addressed.

. Consider modifying the amr ref indicator API slightly in order to avoid clashing pp keywords in amr
  Perhaps something like this:
    amr.refinement_indicator_list = RefineBox
    amr.refinement_indicator.RefineBox.in_box_lo = 0 0.1 0.2
    amr.refinement_indicator.Refinebox.in_box_hi = 0.1 2.1 4.3
. Implement thread-safe form of turbulent inflow stuff from PeleC/Maui
. Implement/extend unit test feature from PeleLM_NS allowing "pelelmevaluate"
. Add Tutorial codes, and PeleLM usage advice (out-of-source builds, etc.)


//--------------------------//

Issues solved:

. Consider switching BC input flags to be text-based to manage energy and flow BCs with more flexibility.
  This will require divorcing a bit more from IAMR, since IAMR manages those options currently.

   ->  Note that now we split Initialize with a Initialize_specific routine
