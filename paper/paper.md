# Statement of Need

While there exist several reactive flow Direct Numerical Simulation codes, PeleLM present a unique set of features. 
From its creation, under the name LMC in the early 2000, the motivation was to combine an AMR approach with a low Mach number formulation
 to achieve high performances from a small desktop station to the largest supercomputer.
